# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Analysis

# Introduction
In the competitive telecom industry, customer churn analysis plays a crucial role in understanding customer behavior and reducing customer attrition. Churn rate, which measures the number of customers who cancel or do not renew their subscriptions, directly impacts a company's revenue. Therefore, it is essential for telecom companies to identify potential churners and implement strategies to retain them.

This project aims to classify potential churn customers based on various numerical and categorical features. It addresses a binary classification problem using an imbalanced dataset.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following attributes:

--> customerID: Customer ID  
--> gender: Whether the customer is male or female  
--> SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (1 for yes, 0 for no)  
--> Partner: Whether the customer has a partner (Yes or No)  
--> Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents (Yes or No)  
--> tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the company  
--> PhoneService: Whether the customer has phone service (Yes or No)  
--> MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines (Yes, No, or No phone service)  
--> InternetService: Customer's internet service provider (DSL, Fiber optic, or No)  
--> OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> TechSupport: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> StreamingMovies: Whether the customer has streaming movies (Yes, No, or No internet service)  
--> Contract: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, or Two year)  
--> PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes or No)  
--> PaymentMethod: The customer's payment method (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, or Credit card)  
--> MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer monthly  
--> TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer  
--> Churn: Whether the customer churned (Yes or No)  


# Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models that accurately classify potential churn customers based on the provided dataset attributes. By analyzing customer demographics, services subscribed to, billing information, and contract details, we aim to identify patterns and indicators of churn behavior.

# Methodology:
1.)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any correlations.
Visualize the data to gain insights into customer demographics and behaviors.
2.)Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Normalize numerical features and handle any outliers.
3.)Feature Engineering:
Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.

4.)Model Building:
Train various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.)Model Selection and Optimization:
Select the best-performing model and fine-tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

6.)Model Evaluation:
Validate the final model on a holdout dataset or through cross-validation to assess its generalization performance.

7.)Deployment and Monitoring:
Deploy the trained model into production for real-time prediction.
Monitor model performance and retrain periodically to adapt to changing customer behavior.


# Conclusion
Telecom customer churn analysis is crucial for retaining customers and maximizing revenue. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing customer data, telecom companies can proactively identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them. This project aims to provide actionable insights and predictive models to help telecom companies reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
